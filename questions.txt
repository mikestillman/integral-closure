1) Shamash/Eagon resolution for modules?

2) Start with the case of a complete intersection -- where is the minimization happening? Also the case of a hyperplane section of a codim 2 perfect.

3) codim 3: the ACI cases are also simple.

4) codim 3: Is the lift of zero products part of beta? (and is this the Massey structure in this case?)

4') What is the interaction with the different types of Tor algebras? Avramov's formula for the poincare series in terms of invariants of the tor multiplication suggests yes. How was it proven?

The multiplicative structures were discovered by Jerzy on the basis of representation theory; alternate description (by Kustin-Miller?) via linkage.

5) Can beta be chosen equivariant for the Kac-Moody structure? In the Dynkin cases? 

6) How do these things change with linkage?

7) "compression" of beta: filtration by X(i) i<= p?

8) Irena: what's the minimal free res of m generic forms (eg quadrics) in n<m variables?
What's the koszul homology/Massey structure?
